7. Look for memory issues.
8. Opening contacts files with more than 20 contacts does not work correctly.
9. Sorting data does not work.
10. Translation from input menu to Field enumeration is fragile.
11. No easy way to add a new field to the contacts
12. Would be better to back the data up via SQLite than a text file.
